# Solitary Project Kanban Board

## Board Overview
This kanban board tracks all development tasks for the Solitary GameMaker project. Tasks move through stages from left to right as work progresses.

## Current Project Status (2025-09-20 Day 4)

### Major Milestone: UI Visibility Crisis RESOLVED âœ“
**Critical Achievement**: Discovered and fixed fundamental GameMaker UI visibility issue
- **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: visible=false blocks ALL draw events, including Draw_64 (GUI layer)
- **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: visible=true + sprite_index=-1 for UI objects without sprites
- Clock: Always visible, static positioning for consistent visibility
- Money: Now properly visible at top-left with icon display (was completely invisible)
- Schedule: TAB-toggleable slide animation from left, matching needs panel behavior
- Needs: TAB-toggleable slide animation from right with color-coding, warning flashes and tooltip system
- Debug Tools: Enhanced with F1 key + NEW F10 key for UI visibility diagnostics
- **TECHNICAL DEBT ELIMINATED**: No more invisible UI elements, comprehensive debugging added
- **LATEST**: Schedule Slide Animation Feature - Both schedule and needs panels slide in/out with TAB key

### Current Focus: Foundation Systems Implementation
**Next Priority**: Time System (SOL-001) and Save/Load System (SOL-003)
**Sprint Status**: Day 4 of Sprint 3 - UI simplification complete, moving to core systems

### Technical Debt Status: ELIMINATED
- **MAJOR ISSUE RESOLVED**: UI visibility crisis caused by incorrect visible property usage
- UI rendering architecture now stable with proper visible=true + sprite_index=-1 pattern
- Object hierarchy properly managed on UI_Layer with correct visibility settings
- Comprehensive debug infrastructure in place (F1 + F10 diagnostics)
- **GameMaker Knowledge Gap CLOSED**: Team now understands visible property behavior
- No known critical bugs blocking development
