UI VISIBILITY FIX SUMMARY
========================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
- Money display and schedule display were not visible in the game
- Root cause: visible = false was preventing Draw GUI events from executing

GAMEMAKER BEHAVIOR CLARIFICATION:
- When visible = false: ALL draw events are skipped, including Draw GUI
- When visible = true with sprite_index = -1: Object is active but sprite is not drawn

FIXES APPLIED:

1. obj_money_display (Create_0.gml):
   - Changed from: visible = false
   - Changed to: visible = true; sprite_index = -1;
   - Added debug logging in Draw_64.gml

2. obj_schedule_display (Create_0.gml):
   - Changed from: visible = false
   - Changed to: visible = true; sprite_index = -1;
   - Added debug logging in Draw_64.gml

3. obj_needs_display (Create_0.gml):
   - Removed conflicting visible settings
   - Set to: visible = true; sprite_index = -1;
   - Added debug logging in Draw_64.gml

DEBUGGING TOOLS ADDED:

1. Script: scr_verify_ui_visibility
   - Comprehensive verification of all UI objects
   - Checks visibility, sprite index, and values
   - Reports GUI dimensions

2. Hotkey: F10 (in obj_game_controller)
   - Triggers verify_ui_visibility() function
   - Outputs detailed diagnostic report

TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Run the game
2. The UI elements should now be visible:
   - Money display (top-left)
   - Schedule display (bottom-left)
   - Needs display (animated from right)

3. Press F10 to run UI visibility verification
4. Check debug console for:
   - "[MONEY] Draw GUI event executing..." messages
   - "[SCHEDULE] Draw GUI event executing..." messages
   - "[NEEDS] Draw GUI event executing..." messages
   - Full verification report

KEY LESSON:
In GameMaker, to have an object that:
- Executes Draw GUI events
- But doesn't draw its sprite in the room

Use: visible = true; sprite_index = -1;
NOT: visible = false;

This ensures Draw GUI events run while hiding the sprite.
