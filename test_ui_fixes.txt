UI Fixes Testing Checklist
==========================

1. EXTRA COIN SPRITE FIX:
   - Added visible = false to obj_money_display Create event
   - This prevents the sprite from rendering in the game room
   - Money should only appear in GUI layer via Draw_64 event

2. SCHEDULE DISPLAY FIX:
   - Adjusted display_y calculation from (gui_height - 280) to (gui_height - 200)
   - This should make the schedule visible at bottom-left
   - Schedule already had visible = false in Create event

3. MONEY ICON POSITIONING:
   - Updated sprite drawing to check for valid sprite_index
   - Adjusted icon position to (display_x + 16, display_y + 16)
   - Text position adjusted to align with icon

4. NEEDS DISPLAY FIX:
   - Added visible = false to obj_needs_display Create event
   - Prevents any sprite from showing in game room

All UI elements should now:
- Only render in Draw_64 (GUI layer)
- Not show sprites in the game room
- Be properly positioned on screen

To test:
1. Run the game
2. Check that no extra coin sprites appear in the room
3. Verify schedule is visible at bottom-left
4. Confirm money display shows correctly at top-left
5. Check that needs bars display properly on right side
