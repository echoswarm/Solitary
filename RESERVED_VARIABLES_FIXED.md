# Reserved Variable Names Fixed

## Date: 2025-09-19

## Problem
GameMaker compile errors due to using reserved/read-only variable names:
- `current_hour` - reserved
- `current_minute` - reserved
- `current_day` - likely reserved
- `current_second` - likely reserved
- `current_activity` - potential conflict

## Solution Applied
Renamed all reserved variables with `game_` prefix throughout the project:

### Variable Replacements:
- `current_hour` → `game_hour`
- `current_minute` → `game_minute`
- `current_day` → `game_day`
- `current_activity` → `game_activity`

### Files Modified:

1. **obj_time_system/Create_0.gml**
   - Changed initial variable declarations to use `game_` prefix
   - Added `paused = false` variable for game state management

2. **obj_time_system/Step_0.gml**
   - Updated all time increment logic to use new variable names
   - Added pause check at beginning of Step event

3. **obj_time_system/Draw_64.gml**
   - Updated display code to use `game_hour`, `game_minute`, `game_day`

4. **obj_schedule_display/Create_0.gml**
   - Changed `current_hour` → `game_hour`
   - Changed `current_activity` → `game_activity`

5. **obj_schedule_display/Draw_64.gml**
   - Updated to read `obj_time_system.game_hour`
   - Changed all references to use new variable names

6. **obj_needs_display/Step_0.gml**
   - Used local variable `hour_check` instead of `current_hour`
   - Used local variable `activity_check` instead of `current_activity`
   - Updated reference to `obj_time_system.game_hour`

## Additional Fixes:

### Added Missing Variables:
- Added `paused` variable to obj_time_system/Create_0.gml
- Added pause logic to obj_time_system/Step_0.gml

### Code Quality Improvements:
- Used descriptive local variable names in obj_needs_display to avoid any naming conflicts
- Maintained all existing functionality while fixing compile errors

## Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Project compiles without errors
- [ ] Time system advances properly (1 real second = 1 game minute)
- [ ] Schedule display shows correct current activity
- [ ] Needs system updates based on time and activities
- [ ] Pause/unpause functionality works correctly
- [ ] Day counter increments properly at midnight

## Next Steps:
1. Compile the project in GameMaker Studio to verify all errors are fixed
2. Test all time-based systems are working correctly
3. Continue with Day 3 implementation tasks

## Notes:
- GameMaker has many reserved variables that cannot be redeclared
- Always check the manual for reserved words when naming variables
- Using prefixes like `game_` helps avoid conflicts with built-in variables
