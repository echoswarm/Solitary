# GameMaker Project Synchronization Report
## Date: 2025-09-19

### Summary
The GameMaker project has been successfully synchronized. All recent UI changes and modifications have been verified and properly registered in the project files.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Script Registration Updates
**Added 2 missing scripts to Solitary.yyp:**
- `scr_movement` - Located in Scripts/Utility folder
- `scr_needs_system` - Located in Scripts/Gameplay folder

These scripts were present in the file system but were not registered in the main project file, which would have caused them to be invisible in the GameMaker IDE.

### Resource Verification Results

| Objects | 13 | 13 | ✓ Synchronized |
| Scripts | 6 | 6 | ✓ Synchronized |
| Sprites | 12 | 12 | ✓ Synchronized |
