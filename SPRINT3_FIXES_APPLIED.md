# Sprint 3 - Immediate Fixes Applied
## Date: 2025-09-19

## Fixes Completed

### 1. CHARACTER VISIBILITY - FIXED
**Files Modified:**
- `objects/obj_inmate/Draw_0.gml` - Added `draw_self()`
- `objects/obj_guard/Draw_0.gml` - Added `draw_self()`

**Result:** Characters should now be visible when the game runs

### 2. DOOR ANIMATION - FIXED
**Files Modified:**
- `objects/obj_door/Create_0.gml` - Added `image_speed = 0` and state variables
- `objects/obj_door/Step_0.gml` - Added E key interaction system

**Result:** Doors no longer animate continuously, can be opened/closed with E key

### 3. CLOCK DISPLAY - IMPLEMENTED
**Files Modified:**
- `objects/obj_time_system/Create_0.gml` - Added time variables and display settings
- `objects/obj_time_system/Step_0.gml` - Added time progression logic (1 sec = 1 min)
- `objects/obj_time_system/Draw_64.gml` - Added GUI drawing for clock

**Result:** Clock displays "Day X - HH:MM" at top center of screen

### 4. BASIC MOVEMENT - IMPLEMENTED
**Files Modified:**
- `objects/obj_inmate/Create_0.gml` - Added movement variables
- `objects/obj_inmate/Step_0.gml` - Added arrow key movement with collision

**Result:** Inmate can move with arrow keys, collides with doors

## Testing Instructions

1. **Open GameMaker Studio 2**
2. **Load the Solitary project**
3. **Press F5 or click Run**
4. **Verify the following:**

### Visual Checks:
- [ ] Inmate sprite visible in cell
- [ ] Guard sprite visible at guard station
- [ ] Three doors visible and static (not animating)
- [ ] Clock displays "Day 1 - 06:00" at top center
- [ ] Money display shows coin icon (top right)
- [ ] Schedule display visible (top right area)
- [ ] Needs display panel visible

### Functionality Checks:
- [ ] Arrow keys move the inmate
- [ ] Inmate stops at doors (collision works)
- [ ] Pressing E near a door opens/closes it
- [ ] Clock time advances (watch for 06:01 after 1 second)
- [ ] Inmate stays within room bounds

## Next Steps (Phase 2 - Core Systems)

### Tomorrow's Priority Tasks:
1. **Game State Controller**
   - Create state machine (MENU, PLAYING, PAUSED, GAMEOVER)
   - Add pause functionality (ESC key)

2. **Enhanced Time System**
   - Add pause/resume capability
   - Trigger events at specific times

3. **Schedule System**
   - Create daily schedule array
   - Display current activity
   - Check allowed locations

---

## Code Structure Added

### Time System
```gml
// Time progresses at 1:1 ratio (1 real second = 1 game minute)
current_hour = 6;
current_minute = 0;
current_day = 1;
```

### Movement System
```gml
// Simple arrow key movement with collision
move_speed = 2;
// Checks collision with doors before moving
```

### Door Interaction
```gml
// E key within 48 pixels toggles door state
is_open = false/true;
image_index = 0 (closed) or 1 (open);
```

---

## Known Issues to Address

1. **Door Collision**: Currently blocks when open or closed (needs refinement)
2. **No Save System**: Progress not saved yet
3. **No Needs Decay**: Hunger/cleanliness not decreasing
4. **No Schedule Enforcement**: Can go anywhere anytime
5. **No Win/Loss Conditions**: Game doesn't end

---

## Files Ready for Phase 2

All core objects have their basic events created and are ready for enhanced functionality:
- obj_game_controller (needs state machine)
- obj_schedule_system (needs schedule array)
- obj_needs_system (needs decay logic)
- obj_save_controller (needs save/load functions)

---

## Sprint 3 Progress

### Day 1 Goals - COMPLETED:
- ✅ Fixed character visibility
- ✅ Fixed door animation loops
- ✅ Added clock display
- ✅ Added basic movement

### Day 2 Goals - UP NEXT:
- [ ] Game state machine
- [ ] Pause functionality
- [ ] Enhanced time system
- [ ] Schedule system basics

## Quick Test Checklist

Run the game and verify:
1. **Start**: See prison room with all objects
2. **Move**: Arrow keys move inmate smoothly
3. **Interact**: E key near door opens/closes it
4. **Time**: Clock shows time advancing
5. **Bounds**: Can't leave room edges

If all checks pass, Phase 1 is complete!
